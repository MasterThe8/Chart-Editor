# eLJe | Lyric Jutsu Chart Editor


## About
This software makes it easy for Clone Hero Charter to edit lyrics from chart files (.charts) with a PlainText-based display. As well as being able to manipulate/method on lyrics which for now is usually called "Lyric Jutsu". This program displays the "Events" session section of the Chart file and Highlights the Syntax of the code. Thus, it makes it easier for users to edit and be creative in manipulating lyrics. There are several additional features in performing Lyric Jutsu such as "Symbol", "Add Jutsu", "Lyric Color (method 1)", "Lyric Color (method 2)", and "Kan2Rom".

This application has many shortcomings / bugs., and I apologize for these deficiencies. I built this application using Python GUI (QT) manually coding.

#### Bugs:
- When you open a .chart file and an error message appears $${\color{red}"Wrong event format detected!"}$$. Disable the 'Display Lyrics' feature by pressing the computer icon on the Toolbar.
- Events 'Section' may be lost when applying 'Lyric Color (method 1)' and 'Kan2Rom'. So be careful and use 'Temp Text' as temporary text storage.
